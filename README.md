# Backup-Among-Us-Bot
A lightweight discord bot built on discord.js for among us VCs
**This is a backup version of [this repo.](https://github.com/Lord-Giganticus/Among-Us-Bot)**

# Notes:
I won’t be able to keep the bot online 24/7 but I’ll try to have it online as long as possible.

# How to contribute:
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it
3. Change branch to backup-bot
4. In the nodejs folder use a terminal to run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Go to the developer tab of discord.com to make a bot and nab its token.
6. Put the token in the put-token-here area of example_config.json and save it as config.json
7. Run the bot either using your terminal or `run-pm2.bat` or `run-node.bat`
8. When you commit new stuff to your forked repo and think it'll be of good use make a PR

**I HIGHLY RECOMEND YOU DO NOT PUT THE BOT'S TOKEN IN BACKUP-AMONG-US-BOT.JS INSTEAD MAKE A CONFIG.JSON FILE.** I have made a example file in the nodejs folder
