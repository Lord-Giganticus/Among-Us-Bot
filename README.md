# Among-Us-Bot + Backup-Bot
Two lightweight discord bots built on discord.js for among us VCs

# Notes:
I won’t be able to keep the bots online 24/7 but I’ll try to have it online as long as possible.

# How to contribute:
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it
3. Either use `Install.py` from the [Latest Release of it](https://github.com/Lord-Giganticus/Among-Us-Bot/releases/latest) or do `npm install` in the bot folders.
4. Go to the developer tab of discord.com to make a bot and nab its token.
5. Put the token in the put-token-here area of example_config.json and save it as config.json
6. Run the bot either using your terminal or the .bat files in the repo (`yarn install pm2` if you want to install pm2 rly easily.)
7. When you commit new stuff to your forked repo and think it'll be of good use make a PR.

**I HIGHLY RECOMEND YOU DO NOT PUT THE BOT'S TOKEN IN AMONG-US-BOT.JS OR BACKUP-AMONG-US-BOT.JS INSTEAD MAKE A CONFIG.JSON FILE.** I have made a example file in the nodejs and nodejs/backup-bot folders
